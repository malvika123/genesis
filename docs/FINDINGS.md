# What keeps a Genesis world alive — a research log

Every time a piece of the real world is added to Genesis, we test whether populations survive better or
worse, and write it down here: what was added, why (the real-world evidence), how it was tested, what
happened, and how much to trust it. Over time this becomes an answer to a real question:

> **Which features of the real world are must-haves for a population of learning creatures to last?**

Entries are kept even when the result was "no effect" or "it made things worse" — those are findings too.

## How the tests are run

- Each test runs many **seeded worlds** with `tools/experiment.js`; a seed fixes everything, so the same
  command on the same commit gives the same result.
- The fairest comparison is **the same seeds, the same code, one feature switched on or off**
  (`--no-vicar`, `--no-picky`, `--old-sound`, `--no-calls`, `--modern-voice`, `--brain N`). Where the
  change itself alters how worlds are generated (for example, adding brain inputs reshuffles the random
  numbers), worlds with the same seed are no longer the same world, and only averages over many worlds
  can be compared — such entries are marked **confounded**.
- "People alive" is the mean number of people alive at the end. With 12 worlds the world-to-world spread is
  large (roughly ±1.5–2 people on the mean), so small differences mean nothing.
- **Evidence strength:** *strong* (large effect, many worlds), *moderate* (clear effect, ~12 worlds),
  *weak* (few worlds or confounded), *none* (no measurable effect).

## Summary: must-haves so far

| Real-world feature | Effect on survival | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| A band of families of all ages (≈25 people, children with mothers, grandmothers) instead of 8 young adults, with parents feeding hungry young and inborn approach/avoid drives | From 3 of 4 worlds dying out (and 1 person left in the 4th) to 3 of 6 worlds thriving after 150 days with 3 generations; child survival to 12 from ~17% to ~56% (foragers ≈50%) | moderate |
| Big carrion birds behaving as real ones do (they wait while predators feed; vultures only in warm lands) | Unrealistic vultures cut survival from 9.2 to 5.8 people; realistic ones restored it (8.8) | moderate |
| Pack breeding limited to one female (reproductive suppression, as in wolves) once mothers paid the real cost of young | Without it predators boomed (17.4 vs 13.2) and people fell (7.2); with it back to 8.7 | moderate |
| Learning from what happens to others (feeling a share of their pain; choosy copying) | 11.1 vs 9.3 alive; predator deaths 33 → 16 | moderate |
| **Not** a must-have: bigger brains on their own | 64 units: 8.2 alive, 256: 6.1, 1,024: 2.2 | strong |
| **Not** measurable: sound by real physics, animal calls | 7.7 / 6.7 / 7.1 alive (within noise) | none |

What still kills whole bands (open): predators near where the band starts, wildfire (people only react to
heat beside them), and hunger.

## Log

### 1. Learning from others: vicarious pain and choosy copying — Nov 2026

**Added.** A person who sees someone nearby hurt, sick or killed feels a weaker share of the pain as its
own learning signal and fear (family and children most; attacks, fire, falls, drowning and bad food
most). Copying favours those doing well, is stronger when unsure, and can follow the majority; how much
each person learns from others is inherited.

**Real-world basis.** Observational fear learning engages the amygdala as direct experience does (Olsson &
Phelps 2007); empathy for pain depends on group membership (Hein et al. 2010); prepared fears (Cook &
Mineka 1990); social learning strategies (Kendal et al. 2018); consistent individual differences, ~20% of
people never use social information (Molleman et al. 2014).

**Test.** 12 worlds × 30 days, same code, three ways (all on; no vicarious pain; neither).

**Result.** First version: vicarious pain alone made no difference (6.9 vs 6.8 alive); choosy copying cut
survival (hunger 42 vs 32) because "copy when unsure" raised overall copying ~40% and the success bias
picked teachers too far away to watch. After recalibrating (typical unsureness → typical copying;
prefer the successful only among those close by): **11.1 alive with both on vs 9.3 with neither;
predator deaths 33 → 16.**

**Strength.** Moderate (12 worlds). **Lesson:** how much creatures copy matters as much as whom they copy.

### 2. Closing the food chain: decay, scavengers, soil — Nov 2026

**Added.** Bodies are eaten by insects and microbes at a pace set by warmth (most of a carcass gone in about
three weeks of summer; none while frozen); carrion birds; soil enriched by rot and dung feeds the grass.

**Real-world basis.** Carcass decomposition and "cadaver decomposition islands" (Carter et al. 2007; >90%
mass loss in ~20 days for small carcasses in summer); vultures in the Serengeti eat much of the carrion
(Houston); at kills, large carnivores feed first and scavengers wait; vultures live in warm lands, ravens
and eagles scavenge in the north (Wilmers et al. 2003).

**Test.** 12 worlds × 40 days: before; with vultures that stripped any carcass within a day; with
realistic vultures.

| | People alive | Predator kills of people | Hunters at end |
|---|---|---|---|
| No food chain | 9.2 | 39 | 12.1 |
| Unrealistic vultures | 5.8 (1 world died out) | 45 | 14.5 |
| Realistic vultures | 8.8 (none died out) | 31 | 13.2 |

**Interpretation.** When vultures took predators' leftovers, predators hunted more — including people. When
vultures wait their turn, as on Earth, the effect disappears. **Strength:** moderate. **Lesson:**
competition between scavengers and predators is part of what keeps prey (people) safe.

### 3. Pregnancy, and what really limits wolves — Nov 2026

**Added.** Gestation for each species' real length; part of the cost during pregnancy and most of it as
milk afterwards; loss when the mother starves; labour pain; ~1% maternal death per human birth.

**Finding along the way.** In the old code a mother paid her whole litter's cost in one instant at birth,
often more energy than she had, so many mother wolves **died right after giving birth**: an unrealistic
accident that was quietly keeping predators down. With realistic costs, predators boomed (17.4 hunters vs
13.2) and people suffered (7.2 alive, 2 worlds died out).

**Fix from the real world.** In a wolf pack only one female breeds; the others' breeding is suppressed
(reproductive suppression in wolves and wild dogs). With it: 8.7 people, 13.5 hunters, fish and
plant-eaters at normal numbers.

**Also learned.** Charging every young the same cost crashed fish (a clutch of eggs is cheap); costs now
scale with what young really cost.

**Strength.** Moderate (12 worlds per version; versions confounded by changes to random numbers).
**Lesson:** an unrealistic mechanism can hide another missing one — remove a hack and look for the real
regulator.

### 4. Sound by the physics of air, and animal calls — Nov 2026

**Added.** Spherical spreading, air absorption by pitch and humidity, foliage, wind and day/night
refraction, background noise; wolves howl, big cats roar, plant-eaters snort an alarm.

**Test.** The same 12 worlds × 40 days three ways: old hearing rule and silent animals; physics with silent
animals; physics with calls.

**Result.** 7.7 / 6.7 / 7.1 people alive — within noise. Predator kills of people were lower with animal
calls (35) than without (51), but hunger moved the other way. **Strength:** none for survival; the
predator-warning effect is a hypothesis worth testing with more worlds.

### 5. Bigger brains — Nov 2026

**Test.** 24 worlds × 40 days at each of 64, 256 and 1,024 thinking units per person.

| Brain | People alive | Worlds died out | Hunger deaths |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | 8.2 ± 1.3 | 3 | 94 |
| 256 | 6.1 ± 1.1 | 3 | 134 |
| 1,024 | 2.2 ± 0.6 | 6 | 119 |

**Interpretation.** Not the brain's energy cost (it is capped the same at every size) but learning speed:
more connections to tune from the same few experiences in a short life. Matches the biology that big
brains pay only with a long, provisioned childhood. **Strength:** strong. **Lesson:** a bigger brain is
not a must-have; the conditions to learn with it are.

### 6. Pair bonds and fidelity — Nov 2026

**Added.** Bonds that grow with time together and mating, partner preference; later, bonded partners feel
less pull toward others (oxytocin: Scheele et al. 2012).

**Result.** Share of siblings who share a father: ~30% → ~49% (humans ≈66%: Dyble 2026; chimpanzees 4%).
Letting males mate again soon after (as real males can) lowered it to ~19% in one run, and later runs
gave 40–54%. Survival unchanged within noise. **Strength:** weak–moderate. Not a survival must-have in
these runs.

### 7. Surviving as our ancestors did — Nov 2026

**Problem.** 40-day checks looked fine, but long runs showed slow collapse: 4 worlds × 300 days with 8 young
founders — 3 died out (days 100, 173, 277), 1 person left in the 4th. A trace of two worlds: bands fell
from 8 to 2–4 within 30 days; 5 of 6 children died before 12 (~83%); skills found once (fishing) were
almost never repeated.

**Added.** A band of 25 of all ages (Kelly 2013: bands of 20–40); parents and grandmothers moved to feed
their own hungry young; inborn approach to visible food and fresh water when hungry or thirsty and
wariness of big hunters; a big unexpected success sticks after one try and striking memories are replayed
most in sleep; swimming (instinctive for animals, learned by people).

**Result.** Trace of the same two worlds × 120 days: world 101 kept 8 people alive at day 120 (vs 0),
**23 of 41 children reached 12 (~56%; foragers ≈50%)**, 7 people caught fish, one six times. World 103
still died out (predators 13, hunger 11; the band had started where days reached 42–44 °C). Long check, 6
worlds × 150 days: **3 worlds alive with 9, 34 and 10 people after 3 generations; 3 died out** (predators
22 and 15; one wildfire killed 19). Someone learned to swim in every world; fire was made once.

**Strength.** Moderate for the overall change (it bundles several features; their separate contributions
are not yet measured — an ablation is needed). **Lesson:** group size, family structure and provisioning
of children look like must-haves; so does keeping what one success taught.

## Open questions (next tests)

- Ablate the bundle in entry 7: which of band size, parental feeding, instincts, one-shot memory and
  swimming carry the effect?
- Where the band starts (temperature, nearness of predators) and fleeing wildfire: do realistic versions
  stop the remaining die-outs?
- Do animal calls reduce predator deaths with 24+ worlds?
- Over 300+ days and many generations, do voice control, pointing and the brain's word area evolve?
